I am writing to express my interest in the Graduate Software Engineer position at Babcock, as
advertised. With a Master's degree in Computer Science from Swansea University, and extensive
experience in software development, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to
high-performance, reliable software systems in varied environments.

At the Cyber Innovation Hub Wales, I led R&D in security solutions, leveraging my skills in machine
learning and cryptography. This role honed my ability to engineer software for diverse applications
â€“ from compliance automation tools to smart intrusion detection systems. My commitment to quality
and innovation aligns perfectly with Babcock's ethos of creating proven, reliable, and integrated
software for complex systems.

I am particularly drawn to the programme's emphasis on a broad exposure to different sectors and
projects. My academic and professional journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in several
programming languages and technologies, including Rust, Go, C++, and Java. I am eager to apply this
knowledge to the diverse challenges at Babcock, from developing desktop applications to contributing
to large-scale projects like ship handling systems.

I am also excited about the prospect of being part of a multi-disciplinary team, understanding the
bigger picture of software's interaction with systems and interfaces. My experience as a Teaching
Assistant at Swansea University, where I supported students in Java programming labs, has honed my
collaborative skills and my ability to communicate complex technical concepts effectively.

Babcock's commitment to employee development, particularly through the Graduate Development
Programme, is highly appealing. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of continuous learning and
contributing to STEM outreach and volunteering activities, aligning with my personal and
professional goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my
background, skills, and enthusiasm for software engineering make me an ideal candidate for this
role.
