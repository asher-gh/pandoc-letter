I am writing to express my keen interest in the Software Engineer
position at Callen-Lenz, as advertised on [LinkedIn]. Callen-Lenz's
commitment to UAS technology innovation, rapid growth, and dynamic work
culture strongly resonate with my career aspirations. I am enthusiastic
about the opportunity to contribute to your team's pioneering work in
the aerospace industry. Moreover, the core values of teamwork,
commitment, initiative, creativity, agility, integrity, and enjoyment
align perfectly with my personal ethos. The chance to work in
picturesque Wiltshire, near Salisbury, on diverse and cutting-edge
projects is highly appealing. I am particularly drawn to the prospect of
witnessing the full lifecycle of products and collaborating on various
platforms for diverse clients.

My qualifications include a Masters degree in Computer Science and a
strong background in software engineering and mechanical engineering.
Proficient in programming languages like C and Rust, I excel in software
design, implementation, and testing, ensuring reliability and
maintainability in the code base. I am also well-versed in tools such as
Jira and Gitlab.

My experience in C programming for embedded systems, Git knowledge, and
exposure to Linux programming further enhance my suitability. I am eager
to expand my skills in Real-Time and Embedded software while bringing a
genuine passion for aviation to the role.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Callen-Lenz's UAS
development and would welcome the chance to discuss my fit for your
organization in greater detail. Please find my resume attached for your
reference.

Thank you for considering my application.
