I am writing to express my interest in the software engineering intern position
at Ripple. I am a highly motivated computer science student with a passion for
developing innovative solutions to complex problems. My experience in software
development, combined with my eagerness to learn, make me a strong candidate for
this role.

As a CS graduate, I have honed my skills in multiple programming languages,
including JavaScript, Python, Java, C++ and Rust. I have also had the
opportunity to work on several projects, ranging from simple scripts to complex
applications. These experiences have helped me develop strong problem-solving
and critical thinking skills, which I am confident will be valuable assets in
this role.

I am particularly drawn to Ripple because of its innovative technology and
commitment to making a positive impact in the financial sector. I am eager to
contribute to the development of Ripple's cutting-edge solutions and be a part
of a team that is making a difference in the world.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to
further discuss my qualifications and enthusiasm for this role.
