I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the opportunity to join Esri as a
Senior Software Engineer. My passion for C++ and systems programming, coupled
with my extensive experience in developing cross-platform applications, makes me
an ideal candidate for this role. At Esri, I am excited about the prospect of
contributing to innovative mapping technology and next-generation GIS solutions.

Currently, I am a Software Engineer at the Cyber Innovation Hub Wales, where my
work involves extensive use of C++ and other languages like Rust and Go for
developing high-performance applications. One of my key projects, '4Cast', a
fully encrypted ICU bed forecast system, was primarily developed in Rust and is
a testament to my proficiency in systems programming and my ability to design
and develop complex applications.

My academic background, including an MSc in Computer Science from Swansea
University, has provided me with a strong foundation in algorithms, data
structures, and design patterns, which are essential for developing robust
software components. Additionally, my experience as a Teaching Assistant and
Demonstrator at Swansea University has honed my communication skills and my
ability to work collaboratively in a team environment.

At Esri, I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on the
cross-platform mapping API and to contribute to the development of field mapping
and data collection tools. My passion for creating software that has real-world
applications aligns perfectly with Esri's mission to improve quality of life
through geography. I am also keen on collaborating with other programmers and
developers throughout the development process to deliver software that meets
user requirements and solves complex problems.

Furthermore, my dedication to continuous learning and growth in the field of
software engineering resonates with Esri's culture of innovation and
development. I am eager to deepen my understanding of GIS technology and
contribute to Esri's mission of empowering governments, universities, and
businesses worldwide.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to
bring my technical expertise and passion for systems programming to Esri, and I
look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.
