I am writing to express my interest in the Graduate Software Engineering role at
Graphcore. I graduated this year with a Master’s degree in Computer Science at
Swansea University, topping in my class. I am passionate about advancing in the
field of AI and machine learning. The opportunity to work with Graphcore’s
innovative team, known for pioneering the Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU),
aligns perfectly with my academic pursuits and my deep interest in AI.

At university, I have completed coursework and projects primarily in Java and
Python, which form the core of Graphcore's development work. My academic
projects, including a desktop application using deep learning for microfluidic
droplet prediction and a real-time packet-based intrusion detection system,
demonstrate my proficiency and hands-on experience in these languages.
Additionally, my interest in AI and ML is evident from my project work and my
eagerness to explore this field further.

What excites me most about this internship is the opportunity to contribute to
Graphcore's cutting-edge hardware and software. The prospect of working
alongside experienced engineers and contributing to real-world machine learning
applications is an incredible opportunity for professional growth. My
adaptability, problem-solving skills, and ability to thrive in collaborative
environments, as demonstrated in my current role at the Cyber Innovation Hub
Wales, will allow me to make a meaningful contribution to your team.

I am particularly drawn to the hands-on development experience and the
mentorship offered at Graphcore. As an action-oriented self-starter, I have
engaged in various extracurricular activities, including coding competitions and
tech meetups, which highlight my enthusiasm for technology and my ability to
work independently and as part of a team.

Thank you for considering my application for the Software Engineering
Internship. I am enthusiastic about the chance to learn and contribute at
Graphcore, a leader in AI computing, and I look forward to the possibility of
further discussing my candidacy.
