I am writing to express my interest in the software engineering internship at
Roku. As a computer science student at Swansea University, I am excited to apply
my skills and knowledge to real-world projects and learn from experienced
professionals in the field.

Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in algorithms, data
structures, and object-oriented programming. In addition, I have completed
coursework in software design and development, including projects that involved
building web applications and native desktop applications. I am confident that
my technical skills and passion for technology make me a strong fit for this
internship. Moreover, I have gained practical experience through teaching Java
programming at an undergraduate level at my University while working as a
teaching assistant and demonstrator, and contributing to open source projects.
I've worked with many programming languages and tools including JavaScript,
Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Python, and Rust. My masters project was building
a desktop GUI application in Rust that provided ML based predictions for
microfluidic droplet formation process.

I am particularly interested in the opportunity to work at Roku because of the
company's innovative approach to streaming media. The chance to contribute to
the development of cutting-edge products that are used by millions of people is
truly exciting to me.

I am pleased to inform you that I am on track to receiving a Master's degree in
Computer Science with distinction, based on my current average of 82%. I believe
that my background in mechanical engineering, combined with my advanced degree
in computer science, make me a unique and valuable asset to your team. I have a
passion for using technology to solve complex problems and am excited to
continue learning and growing as a software engineer.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a team player with strong communication
and problem-solving abilities. I believe that these qualities, combined with my
enthusiasm for technology, make me an asset to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to
contribute to the success of Roku as a software engineering intern.
