I am excited about the opportunity to join the firmware engineering team at your
company and use my technical skills and problem-solving abilities to contribute
to the development of innovative and high-quality products. I am a proactive
learner and excel in dynamic environments, and I am confident that my diverse
background makes me a valuable asset to your team. Thank you for considering my
application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my
qualifications with you.

I have always been interested in the intersection of engineering and computer
science. This led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and
then a master's degree in computer science. Throughout my studies, I have
developed a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering,
including coursework in Software Engineering Principles, Software Testing,
Relational and Object-Oriented Databases, Embedded System Design, Data
Structures and Algorithms. My masters project was building a desktop GUI
application in Rust that provided ML based predictions for microfluidic droplet
formation process. I also have experience working with C, C++, and Rust, as well
as scripting in Lua, Python, and Bash. In my undergraduate studies, I completed
several hands-on projects in which I applied mechanical engineering principles
to design and build prototypes for various applications.

I am pleased to inform you that I am on track to receive a Master's degree in
Computer Science with distinction, with a current average of 82%. I believe that
my background in mechanical engineering, combined with my advanced degree in
computer science, make me a unique and valuable asset to your team. I have a
passion for using technology to solve complex problems and am excited to
continue learning and growing as a software engineer.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to
further discuss how I can contribute to your team.
