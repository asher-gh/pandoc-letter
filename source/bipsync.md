I am writing to apply for the graduate software engineering role at Bipsync
advertised on Jobteaser. As a recent graduate in Computer Science from Swansea
University, I am excited to bring my skills and knowledge to your team.

I have always been interested in the intersection of engineering and computer
science. This led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and
then a master's degree in computer science. Throughout my studies, I have
developed a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering,
including coursework in Software Engineering Principles, Software Testing,
Relational and Object-Oriented Databases, Embedded System Design, Data
Structures and Algorithms. Moreover, I have gained practical experience through
teaching Java programming at an undergraduate level at my University while
working as a teaching assistant and demonstrator, and contributing to open
source projects. I've worked with many programming languages and tools including
JavaScript, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Python, and Rust. My masters project
was building a desktop GUI application in Rust that provided ML based
predictions for microfluidic droplet formation process.

I am pleased to inform you that I am on track to receive a Master's degree in
Computer Science with distinction, with a current average of 82%. I believe that
my background in mechanical engineering, combined with my advanced degree in
computer science, make me a unique and valuable asset to your team. I have a
passion for using technology to solve complex problems and am excited to
continue learning and growing as a software engineer.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to
further discuss how I can contribute to your team at Bipsync.
