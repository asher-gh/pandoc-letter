I'm writing to express my interest in the Quora Software Engineering internship
position. As a recent computer science graduate experienced in web development
and systems programming, I am excited about the opportunity to learn by working
in Quora's dynamic team.

My background in software engineering and hands-on experience with software
development and cyber security have equipped me with proficiency in software development tools like Git, Vim, Linux/Unix, and programming languages like Rust, Go, JavaScript, C++, etc.. This aligns well with the internship's focus
on experience with web development and distributed systems.

Quora's mission to share knowledge resonates with my passion for innovation and
learning. I'm eager to bring my skills to a company that values transparency and impactful work, as outlined in your job description.

I appreciate Quora's commitment to mentorship and inclusivity. My dedication to
continuous improvement and collaborative problem-solving makes me a natural fit
for the internship. I look forward to contributing to Quora's goals and
expanding my skills within your talented team.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm eager to discuss how my background
aligns with Quora's goals in more detail.
